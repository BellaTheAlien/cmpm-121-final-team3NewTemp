# Devlog Entry - [December 1, 2025]

## How we satisfied the software requirements

From F1 requiremnts, we have added some git hooks and player movment/intraction with the world.
For F2 requirement we have added templs to build up our world, each area can be accesed freely to the player.

## Reflection -

# Testing Lead Neila:

Added a git hook to check for any large assest files that we my add that overload the project.
Along with some engine and tools testing as we tried diffrent ways to get the templ assests to load into the web deploment. After a week of trying Lizabeth was finally able to crack the missing code to get the worlds to load in the web popup.
