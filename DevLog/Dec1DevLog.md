## How we satisfied the software requirements

From F1 requiremnts, we have added some git hooks and player movment/intraction with the world.
For F2 requirement we have added templs to build up our world, each area can be accesed freely to the player. We also added a sphere that can be kicked around the world, giving the player something they can interact with and play around with it having some physiscs logic. Along with the ball being able to be kicked around it also has gravity and jumps a little when kicked.

## Reflection -

## Testing Lead Neila

Added a git hook to check for any large assest files that we my add that overload the project.
Along with some engine and tools testing as we tried diffrent ways to get the templ assests to load into the web deploment. After a week of trying Lizabeth was finally able to crack the missing code to get the worlds to load in the web popup.

Later I also changed the player into the capsule so we can use the cude gemomatry again later. Also I added a sphere/ball the player can inctract with using "e" to kick it around the world.
