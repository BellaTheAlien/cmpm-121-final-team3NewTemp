# Devlog Entry - [December 5, 2025]

## Selected Requirements

Identify which of the many options for F3 requirements that your team has decided to satisfy. For each one, offer a sentence or two of detail about why your team selected this requirement. Perhaps it is because it was already satisfied by your F2 design, that it seemed like it would be easy, or that it represents a skill you want to develop or practice.

## How We Satisfied the Software Requirements

For each of your chosen F3 requirements, give a paragraph of explanation for how your project's implementation satisfies the requirements.

### Continuous Inventory

This was a carryover from our F2 requierments. We have 3 keys throughout each scene in our game. You need three keys total to unlock the final door and win. This can be scaled up to have multiple keys of the same color, for example 5 keys with only 3 needed.

### Visual Themes

We have integrated three visual themes into our game: Light, Dark, and Accesibility. These themes change the color of the UI of the game as well as the lighting/skybox within the game. It is linked the the browser's prefered visual style. For example, if you have your browser in the dark theme, the game's dark theme is activated and changes the color of the scene. There is also ways to cycle though the themes to chose the style you want to play the game in. This is activated by both keyboard and touchscreen button.

### Touchscreen

We have both touchscreen and computer control schemes to this game. When using a computer, the game uses keyboard and mouse, but on mobile, touchscreen options are availible. Movement can be controled by a joystick on the left of the screen. Changing scenes is linked to a button on top of the joystick. Interacting with E and restarting puzzles with R are availible on the right. Changing visual styles is a button on the bottom right.

### Unlimited Undo

#### Testing Lead Neila

Added an unlimted redo function that resets the puzzle in the current scene, as of adding it only the first temple scene has a puzzle. But the fuction dose allow for easy addtions.

## Reflection

Looking back on how you achieved the F3 requirements, how has your team’s plan changed since your F3 devlog? There’s learning value in you documenting how your team’s thinking has changed over time.
