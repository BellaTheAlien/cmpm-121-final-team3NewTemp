# Devlog Entry - [November 14, 2025]

## Team 3 - CMPM 121 fall 2025

Tools Lead: Lizbeth De Leon

Engine Lead: Angel Castaneda

Design Lead: Aaron Mai

Testing Lead: Neila Miranda

## Tools and materials

1. Engine: We plan to use [three.js](https://threejs.org) as our main engine due to it's compatability with [TypeScript](typescriptlang.org), which our team has a shared amount of experience with. However, this may change in the future with further internal disscussion.

2. Language: Our main language will initially be TypeScript due to the common experience out team members have with the language. Further talks are required if the breadth of TypeScript's abilities contstrain the project's vision.

3. Tools: We will be using VS Code and GitHub CodeSpaces due to its overall accessibility and since it provides support for the engines we plan on using.

4. Generative AI: Although we are not pushing for the use of Generative AI in this project, We wish for CoPilot to be an option for those in the team who wish to use it. We are not restricting AI usage, which means we are allowing features like auto-complete and direct code editing.

## Outlook

Our team is hoping to learn about three.js because we were intrigued about the types of games that were made with it. Being able to create with TypeScript and access these games on a web browser is something we want to accomplish.
