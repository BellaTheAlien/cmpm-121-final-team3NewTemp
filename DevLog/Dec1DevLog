## How we satisfied the software requirements
For each of the F2 requirements, give a paragraph of explanation for how your project's implementation satisfies the requirements.
Your team can earn partial credit for covering only a subset of the F2 requirements at this stage. (It is much better to satisfy the requirements in a sloppy way right now than lock in your partial credit.)

## Reflection
Looking back on how you achieved the F2 requirements, how has your team’s plan changed since your F1 devlog? There’s learning value in you documenting how your team’s thinking has changed over time.
