# Devlog Entry - [November 19, 2025]

## Repository and Tools Update

### Repository

Our team was having trouble with the shape of our old repository. We decided to change the repository too quickly with too many seperate devices. This new repository is more streamlined than the previous by leveraging existing starter code.

### Pre and Post commit actions

Our repository now has a pre-commit check to match formating before a commit is sent to the main branch. This is done in the form of a linter.

Our new repository also has a better working deployment system for post-commits.

### Tools Update

Taken a temple from CMPM 121 D1 project to get deno and vite base. All starter code and file from D1 project was deleted and the base code we had from our failed repo was moved over.

## Changes to the project

Added phisyics to a green box to fall from the top of the screen. Then we added a platform with collision to act as a floor to catch the box. From there the current project prints out inlogs that the box and floor collited.
