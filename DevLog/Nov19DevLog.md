# Devlog Entry - [November 19, 2025]

## Repository and Tools Update

### Repository

Our team was having trouble with the shape of our old repository. We decided change the repository with too quickly on too many seperate devices. This new repository is more streamlined than the previous by leveraging existing starter code.

### Pre and Post commit actions

Our repository now has a pre-commit check to match formating before a commit is sent to the main branch.

Our new repository also has a better working deployment system for post-commits.

### Tools Update

Put something here later.
